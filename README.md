# FastVPN-project

FastVPN is my first website. It was developed for a university assignment which included some unfortunate constraints in 
terms of what technologies could be used. Ultimately i am somewhat pleased with the outcome considering the very basic and 
fundamental technologies used.

A pure HTML/CSS website featuring:
- UI Design
- CSS animations/transitions
- Performant webpage with appropriate resolution for logos/text.
- SVG illustrations for a clear and optimised user experience.

What i would of liked to implement further:
- Mobile Design/Responsive Design
  > i would of liked to utlise and expand my knowledge of media queries in this project but since this was an assignment 
    that didn't require/accept these features and further, the time limitations and commitments towards other subjects in 
    my studies, i was ultimately deterred.
- Sass implementation
  > i also would of liked to incorporate my knowledge of Sass into this project where i could implement variables for an easily adjustable 
    colour pallete for the website, as well as nesting to better organise my CSS where it is unfortunately quite unorganised 
    as of this instance.
